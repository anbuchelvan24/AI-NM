# Earthquake Prediction Model using Python

### Overview
This project deals with predicting the magnitude of the earthquake based on features such as
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Date and time
- Magnitude Type

### Motivation
The motivation was to experiment with artificial intelligence to predict earthquake and improve disaster management. The prediction of timely earthquake with collected parameters like Date, Location of Earthquake can help others be readily prepared from future events.

### Learning Objective
The following points were the objective of the project . The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.
- Data gathering 
- Data Visualizations 
- Data Preprocessing 
- Data Modelling 
- Model Evaluation 
- Model Deployment 

### Technical Aspect 
- Processing the dataset and splitting into training and test sets.
- Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
- Testing the model with the test data.

### Libraries used
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- basemap
- pandas
